One of the main challenges in the field of supercomputing is the
development of fast and accurate performance models.
Performance prediction is a powerful tool for the efficient deployment of
modern high-end systems, performance optimization of applications and
performance portability. Parallel applications which run
on high core counts commonly fail to scale up accordingly,
suffering from communication overheads. In this thesis,
we search for application-related and topology-related
metrics of communication performance and we study their relation
with network congestion effects, through benchmarking. Combining
this knowledge, we will attempt to predict performance and provide
generic optimization guidelines at runtime for sparse-matrix applications.
