\section{Thesis Abstract}
One of the main challenges in the field of supercomputing is the
development of fast and accurate performance models.
Performance prediction is a powerful tool for the efficient deployment of
modern high-end systems, performance optimization of applications and
performance portability. Parallel applications, running
on high core counts, commonly fail to scale up accordingly,
suffering from communication overheads. In this thesis,
we search for \emph{application} and \emph{topology-related}
metrics of \emph{communication performance} and study their relation
to \emph{network congestion effects}, through benchmarking. Combining
this knowledge, we will attempt to \emph{predict performance} and \emph{provide
generic optimization guidelines} at runtime for sparse-matrix applications.

\section{Scientific Interests}
During my undergraduate studies I obtained a strong interest in the field of mathematics, logic and computer science. I am particularly interested in exploring applications of the above areas in the fields of biology, pharmacology and medicine. I am keen on continuing my academic coursework with a research oriented series of postgraduate studies.
